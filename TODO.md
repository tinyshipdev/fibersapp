Stuff I need to do to make this app work

**Most urgent**

- expand and collapse items
  - add attribute to taskGraph to set whether expanded or collapsed

- ~~add key listeners to perform actions:~~
  - ~~indent left~~
  - ~~indent right~~
  - ~~add task~~

- ~~make text editable and reflected in state~~

**After key stuff is done**

- save state of app somewhere and reload saved state
